# bevy_lookup_curve

Editable lookup curve for Bevy that can be used for animations or other gameplay elements where user-adjustable "feel" is needed.

If you have used AnimationCurve in Unity, this would be an attempt at something similar for Bevy.

## Features
* LookupCurve type with modifiable knots and tangents. Three types of interpolation: Constant, Linear, and Bezier
* Egui based editor
* Asset loader and save functionality
